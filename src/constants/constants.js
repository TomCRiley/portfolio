      "7 day solo project focusing on a Python backend using Django and PostgreSQL. My idea was to build a Reddit-style web forum for video game lovers who want to create channels that focus on specific games, publish content and comment on each other's posts.

This was an ambitious amount of work with many endpoints to design and implement in the time frame, but I‚Äôm proud of the outcome with all the technologies I used for the first time. ",
